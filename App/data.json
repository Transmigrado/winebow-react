              "description": "<p>Chile’s unique geography makes it one of very few grape-growing regions in the world where original European rootstock has been unaffected by phylloxera. While most vineyards around the world are planted on grafted rootstock, Root:1 grapes are grown on pure, ungrafted roots, producing wines of outstanding quality, with pure fruit flavors and authentic varietal character.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Chile’s isolation, protected by the mighty Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, allows grape vines to remain on their original rootstock in their purest form. The country’s optimal climate and soil conditions help produce consistently outstanding grapes each year. The cooler coastal vineyards of Casablanca are ideally suited for Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir, while Cabernet and Carmenere flourish in the warm, sun-drenched central valley of Colchagua.</p><p>Casablanca Valley</p><p>Located just 12 miles from the Pacific Ocean in Tapihue, the estate vineyards of Root: 1 Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir are noted for their intense sun, cool coastal breezes and foggy evenings.</p><p>Colchagua Valley</p><p>Situated along the Tinguiririca River in Peralillo, El Suspiro estate vineyards of Root: 1 Cabernet and Carmenere are noted for their long, dry growing season producing wines of intense flavor.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Root: 1 is located in the Maipo Valley, in the district of San Pedro, an area close to the coast. It was built with efficiency, quality and cutting-edge technology in mind, all of which is exemplified by the winery’s production process. It begins with a gravity-flow system that ensures reception of blemish-free grapes, and continues with the use of sorting tables that transport the fruit to stainless steel fermentation tanks.</p><p>Environmental care is also a key objective. Energy conservation is a priority and water used in the winery is recycled for irrigation. In addition, every effort is made to preserve the surrounding native flora and fauna.</p><p>Production processes conform to rigorous standards set by important certifications such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, the Clean Production Agreement (CPL), and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). In 2011 Viña Ventisquero was awarded a 100% Sustainable Certification by Wines of Chile.</p><p>After getting a degree in agronomy from the Universidad de Chile, Felipe Tosso began his industry career in 1995 at Concha y Toro. After some time as chief winemaker for Concha y Toro’s Peumo Winery, he joined the Viña Ventisquero winemaking team in 2000 and has been the chief winemaker for Root: 1 since its launch in 2006.</p><p>Today Felipe travels the world in an ever-increasing quest to sharpen his winemaking skills, visiting Napa; Sonoma; Priorat, Spain; Australia; and Bordeaux (Canon La Gaffelière, La Mondotte, and Clos de L’Oratoire). As the company’s chief winemaker, he is the driving force behind its pursuit of ever-higher quality. His leadership and dedication to the environment have been instrumental in allowing Viña Ventisquero to become one of the most awarded wineries of Chile, earning certification as a 100% sustainable winery.</p>",

While most vineyards around the world are planted on grafted rootstock, Root:1 grapes are grown on pure, ungrafted roots, producing wines of outstanding quality, with pure fruit flavors and authentic varietal character.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Chile’s isolation, protected by the mighty Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, allows grape vines to remain on their original rootstock in their purest form. The country’s optimal climate and soil conditions help produce consistently outstanding grapes each year. The cooler coastal vineyards of Casablanca are ideally suited for Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir, while Cabernet and Carmenere flourish in the warm, sun-drenched central valley of Colchagua.</p><p>Casablanca Valley</p><p>Located just 12 miles from the Pacific Ocean in Tapihue, the estate vineyards of Root: 1 Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir are noted for their intense sun, cool coastal breezes and foggy evenings.</p><p>Colchagua Valley</p><p>Situated along the Tinguiririca River in Peralillo, El Suspiro estate vineyards of Root: 1 Cabernet and Carmenere are noted for their long, dry growing season producing wines of intense flavor.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Root: 1 is located in the Maipo Valley, in the district of San Pedro, an area close to the coast. It was built with efficiency, quality and cutting-edge technology in mind, all of which is exemplified by the winery’s production process. It begins with a gravity-flow system that ensures reception of blemish-free grapes, and continues with the use of sorting tables that transport the fruit to stainless steel fermentation tanks.</p><p>Environmental care is also a key objective. Energy conservation is a priority and water used in the winery is recycled for irrigation. In addition, every effort is made to preserve the surrounding native flora and fauna.</p><p>Production processes conform to rigorous standards set by important certifications such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, the Clean Production Agreement (CPL), and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). In 2011 Viña Ventisquero was awarded a 100% Sustainable Certification by Wines of Chile.</p><p>After getting a degree in agronomy from the Universidad de Chile, Felipe Tosso began his industry career in 1995 at Concha y Toro. After some time as chief winemaker for Concha y Toro’s Peumo Winery, he joined the Viña Ventisquero winemaking team in 2000 and has been the chief winemaker for Root: 1 since its launch in 2006.</p><p>Today Felipe travels the world in an ever-increasing quest to sharpen his winemaking skills, visiting Napa; Sonoma; Priorat, Spain; Australia; and Bordeaux (Canon La Gaffelière, La Mondotte, and Clos de L’Oratoire). As the company’s chief winemaker, he is the driving force behind its pursuit of ever-higher quality. His leadership and dedication to the environment have been instrumental in allowing Viña Ventisquero to become one of the most awarded wineries of Chile, earning certification as a 100% sustainable winery.</p>",

They quickly realized its potential for producing world-class wines. This ideal setting, which was revitalized in 1995, was home to vines originating from pre-phylloxera rootstock brought from Bordeaux in the middle of XIX century.&nbsp;</p><p>Member of a renowned family that has been dedicated for several generations to the production of high-quality spirits and wines, Alexandra with legendary wine expertise, brought exceptional French winemaking practices to Chile and pioneered the development of fine quality wines from the region.</p><p>Today it is Charles de Bournet Marnier Lapostolle, seventh generation of the family, who holds the reins of the Winery. Together with him is Jacques Begarie, Technical Director &amp; Winemaker, under the advice of the famous winemaker Michel Rolland, who is personally involved in the whole production of Clos Apalta.</p><p>In its short history, Clos Apalta wines have consistently ranked highly (90+ points) among reputable wine trade publications, a testament of the rigorous standards implemented at the winery to produce outstanding wines.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Apalta, Colchagua Valley.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Clos Apalta's&nbsp;philosophy is as simple as it is ambitious: to express terrois in the&nbsp;wines, looking for excellence, elegance and character in a handcrafted wine that can talk about the amazing place that is the Apalta Valley.</p>",

The Alto Maipo benefits from elevation; the warmth of the sun and oscillating winds from the Andes provides ideal conditions for Cabernet Sauvignon. The Central Maipo is prized for its alluvial soils, while the Pacific Maipo, a newcomer, is known for its crisp, maritime influence. WINES OF CHILE 25&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

The cooler coastal vineyards of Casablanca are ideally suited for Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir, while Cabernet and Carmenere flourish in the warm, sun-drenched central valley of Colchagua.</p><p>Casablanca Valley</p><p>Located just 12 miles from the Pacific Ocean in Tapihue, the estate vineyards of Root: 1 Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir are noted for their intense sun, cool coastal breezes and foggy evenings.</p><p>Colchagua Valley</p><p>Situated along the Tinguiririca River in Peralillo, El Suspiro estate vineyards of Root: 1 Cabernet and Carmenere are noted for their long, dry growing season producing wines of intense flavor.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Root: 1 is located in the Maipo Valley, in the district of San Pedro, an area close to the coast. It was built with efficiency, quality and cutting-edge technology in mind, all of which is exemplified by the winery’s production process. It begins with a gravity-flow system that ensures reception of blemish-free grapes, and continues with the use of sorting tables that transport the fruit to stainless steel fermentation tanks.</p><p>Environmental care is also a key objective. Energy conservation is a priority and water used in the winery is recycled for irrigation. In addition, every effort is made to preserve the surrounding native flora and fauna.</p><p>Production processes conform to rigorous standards set by important certifications such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, the Clean Production Agreement (CPL), and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). In 2011 Viña Ventisquero was awarded a 100% Sustainable Certification by Wines of Chile.</p><p>After getting a degree in agronomy from the Universidad de Chile, Felipe Tosso began his industry career in 1995 at Concha y Toro. After some time as chief winemaker for Concha y Toro’s Peumo Winery, he joined the Viña Ventisquero winemaking team in 2000 and has been the chief winemaker for Root: 1 since its launch in 2006.</p><p>Today Felipe travels the world in an ever-increasing quest to sharpen his winemaking skills, visiting Napa; Sonoma; Priorat, Spain; Australia; and Bordeaux (Canon La Gaffelière, La Mondotte, and Clos de L’Oratoire). As the company’s chief winemaker, he is the driving force behind its pursuit of ever-higher quality. His leadership and dedication to the environment have been instrumental in allowing Viña Ventisquero to become one of the most awarded wineries of Chile, earning certification as a 100% sustainable winery.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Founded in 1856, Cousiño-Macul is the only 19th century winery in Chile that remains in the hands of the original founding family. All Cousiño-Macul reserve wines are estate grown, vinted and bottled. After seven generations and over 150 years, Cousiño-Macul’s mission rings clear — to produce world-class wines that are unmistakably Chilean, carrying the distinctive character of the Maipo Valley.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>In 1994, the capital city of Santiago had expanded to the point of completely surrounding the original Macul estate in the southeast of the city, so the search for an additional single estate vineyard location began. In May 1996, the Cousiño family bought 750 acres of land in Buin, an agriculturally rich subregion of the Maipo Valley, about 20 miles southeast of Santiago. The Buin estate met the Cousiños’ ambitious criteria of soil composition, climate and proximity to the Andes Mountains.</p><p>Few wine producers have the opportunity to make a completely new start, incorporating the best of their age-old experience and the most contemporary technology available. As technology continues to advance in the vineyards and wineries around the world, Cousiño Macul has seized this opportunity to innovate while staying true to the most important part of their long history.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>All Cousiño-Macul wines are made entirely with grapes sourced from its two estates located in the Maipo Valley. Both the Macul estate in the southeast of Santiago and the estate in Buin are part of the subregion known as Alto Maipo. The Alto Maipo is appropriately named due to high altitude orientation at the foot of the Andes Mountains. As the snow melts in the spring and summer, the Andes provide an ample source of pure, fresh water for vineyard irrigation. The soil is especially suited for the production of high-quality grapes: shallow, sandy-silky topsoil with rough stone below. All vines are planted on original root systems. Vines for new plantations come from massal selections carried out in the nurseries at Macul over a period of 10 years. This selection has allowed the preservation of genetic material of great value, originally brought to Chile by Luis Cousiño in 1860, including Cabernet and Merlot varieties from Pauillac in Haut-Medoc, and Sauvignon Gris from Martillac in Graves.</p><p>A graduate of the University of Bordeaux in agricultural engineering and oenology, Pascal Marty has held several esteemed positions at renowned wineries around the world. Early in his career he worked in Pauillac, at Baron Philippe de Rothschild in oenological research, viticulture and quality control. While there, he worked on several iconic wines, including the Mouton-Cadet, Chateau Mouton Rothschild, Chateau d’Armialhac and Chateau Clerc Milon. His work later took him to several U.S. wineries and eventually his tremendous talents were sought in Chile, where he worked as oenologist for Almaviva and Baron Philippe de Rothschild.</p><p>In 2003, Pascal joined Cousiño-Macul as their leading oenologist. Soon after taking this role, he was entrusted by the Cousiño family to develop and create Lota, the family’s 150th anniversary wine. Considered one of his greatest achievements thus far, Lota earned a 93-point score from the Wine Advocate with its first vintage. Pascal directs the winemaking team on all of the Cousiño-Macul selections, ensuring adherence to the utmost quality standards established by the family over numerous generations.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Viña Tarapacá was founded in 1874, in the heart of the Maipo Valley. Our mission is to preserve the seal of high quality behind a wide range of wines focused on reds, today present in more than 60 countries worldwide. Tarapacá is part of the VSPT Wine Group, the second largest wine exporter and the first within the national fine wines market.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>The vineyard is located in the Maipo Valley, the most traditional and prestigious valley in Chile for premium red wine production. It is a 2.700 hectares property, with only 611 planted with vineyards. The Mediterranean climate fosters a warm, dry growing season, allowing for wines with big body, mature tannins and medium acidity. The soil is of volcanic origin with medium depth and mainly angular stones.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Our wines begin with the most appropriate soil selection that will match the needs of each varietal to best respect its characteristics. The vineyards are properly managed with techniques that include determining the correct crop load per vine, irrigation methods, trellising style, and vigor management. This care and dedication continues in the winery, with the enthusiasm and devotion of our winemakers in every step of the vinification process, from reception to fermentation and aging, in order to produce high quality, complex, and well-balanced wines.</p><p>Tarapacá wines display their maximum potential, not only in Isla de Maipo vineyards, within Maipo Valley, but also in other valleys. Our winemaking team continuously seeks out new lands in distant valleys where the different varieties best express their natural characteristics. Our winemaking philosophy is aimed at making wines that faithfully reflect Chile’s tremendous soil and climate conditions for grape growing. Our winemaking team is committed to taking maximum advantage of the soil conditions, topography, and climate from each one of the different vineyard blocks for the greatest expression of the grapes.</p>",

Pioneers in cool, coastal viticulture, Leyda is amongst the most awarded wineries in Chile, and is internationally recognized for their Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc. Also dedicated to using the latest technology to analyze every detail of the region, their ongoing research ensures that each variety performs to its maximum potential. The state-of-the-art equipment with a diverse selection of barrel types ensures that Leyda consistently produces some of Chile’s most expressive, highest-quality wines.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>The most distinguishing characteristic of Leyda is its location. Nestled in the rolling hills of Chile’s coastal mountain range, in its namesake Leyda Valley. Just eight miles from the Pacific Ocean, the area has a distinctly cool, maritime climate with moderate, rainy winters, dry summers and a unique influence from the sea.</p><p>Sea breezes and ocean mist carried by the Humboldt Current have a tempering effect on the otherwise hot summers of this latitude. Evening fog moves into the vineyards and dissipates in the early morning, with clear days, lots of sunlight and low relative humidity. These climate characteristics allow grape ripening to take place at a slower pace, prompting a robust development of aromas and fruity flavors, and ensuring a perfect balance of sugar and acidity in the wines.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Planted on rolling hills with low-nutrient, loamy-clay soils, the Leyda vineyards are ideal for producing small yields of concentrated grapes. Within the vineyard, the architecture, density and irrigation levels are constantly adjusted to attain the perfect ripening conditions for each variety. The winery uses the most modern equipment for wine production, including pneumatic presses, gentle pumps and a temperature interchange system for both grapes and must. The cellar has 56 stainless steel tanks of varying capacities, each with temperature control systems. This diversity allows Leyda to separate different lots, and then classify the various components for final blending. The winery uses 70% French and 30% American oak barrels, from the world’s most respected coopers and works with different oak styles to obtain more complexity and elegance in its wines.</p><p>Viviana Navarrete is the exceptionally talented winemaker behind Leyda and part of the new generation of winemakers. She graduated at the top of her class with a degree in oenology from Pontifica Unversidad Catolica de Chile. Viviana’s vision is to harness the potential of the vineyards in Leyda Valley to demonstrate the ability of this area to produce extraordinary and expressive cool-climate wines.</p>",

The Maipu region is home to some of Mendoza's biggest wine names and produces bright, intense, red wines made from&nbsp;Malbec,&nbsp;Cabernet Sauvignon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pinot Noir. The small town of Maipu lies on the southern outskirts of Mendoza City, and vineyard land stretches south from here toward the Mendoza River, encompassing the smaller regions of&nbsp;Barrancas,&nbsp;Lunlunta&nbsp;and Coquimbito. Like much of Mendoza, Maipu's landscape is dominated by flat vineyards with high&nbsp;altitudes– in this case around 2600ft (792.48 m) (792.48 m) (792.48 m) (800m) above sea level. This altitude sees intense sunlight during the day followed by cold nights that are cooled by alpine winds from the Andes Mountains. This diurnal temperature variation slows ripening overnight, extending the growing season and leading to the development of varietal character without losing precious&nbsp;acidity.&nbsp;</p>",

              "description": "<p>In 1902, Nicola Catena, an Italian immigrant, planted his first vineyard in Mendoza, Argentina. The winery has remained under family control — now in its fourth generation — and is one of the few family-owned wine companies in Argentina that remains in Argentine hands. Owned today by Nicolás Catena and his daughter Laura, Bodega Catena Zapata is known as the pioneer of fine wine from Argentina, and Nicolás is recognized as the vintner who revolutionized wine quality in Argentina. A trained economist, Nicolás began this revolution in the early 1980s and continues to challenge himself and his team to make wines that can be counted among the best in the world. His measured approach to viticulture has taken its place in wine history as the pioneer of Malbec and high-altitude viticulture.</p><p>Catena wines, first launched in 1992, set a new standard for quality in South America. The wines immediately proved the quality potential of Argentina and garnered the first outstanding reviews for Argentine wines from worldwide media. After more than 20 years, the wines of Catena continue to lead the way in Argentine viticulture and winemaking. The family and the winery’s employees take great pride in carrying on the tradition that began over a century ago.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>The Catena family’s estate vineyards are located in the premier growing regions of Villa Bastías, Tupungato; Agrelo, Lujan de Cuyo; Lunlunta, Maipu; Gualtallary, Tupungato and La Consulta, San Carlos. Nicolás believes the terroir of Mendoza's high altitude wine country (3,000 - 5,000 feet above sea level) is unique to the world, and the reality of this belief is expressed in every bottle of Catena wine crafted.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Catena Classic - The Catena wines are made from 100% estate-grown fruit from the Catena family’s high-altitude vineyards. These wines are a blend of single varietals from various locations within these vineyard sites. Each vineyard is farmed in preparation for its role in the final blend, and each is harvested and vinified separately in order to preserve the unique expression, aromas and flavors of the fruit. This ultimately brings to the blend the strengths of each vineyard, adding a heightened complexity to the final wine.</p><p>Catena Alta - In the early 1990s, the Catena Alta wines set new standards for Argentine wine internationally, paving the way for a new category of high-end wines from Argentina. With these wines, Bodega Catena Zapata continued their pioneering efforts being the first to release Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay of this quality from Mendoza’s high-altitude wine country.</p><p>It is a truth among viticulturalists that every vineyard has a sweet spot: a series of rows, known as a lot, that produce better quality fruit. Differences in soil structure, clonal selection, row orientation, slope or plantation density result in a mix of wine character and concentration that gives the barrels from these rows a one-of-a-kind personality. The Catenas have spent the last 25 years extensively mapping their estate vineyards in order to discover these lots. The discovery and meticulous nurturing of these special rows gave birth to the Catena Alta wines. Each lot is farmed and vinified separately in order to showcase its unique expression. When brought together, each adds an individual element to the overall complexity of the final wine. Catena Alta is made from a limited production of single varietal wines from historic rows, or lots, in the Catena family’s high-altitude estate vineyards.</p><p>Catena Zapata - Even with the national acclaim of the Catena Alta wines, Nicolás still yearned to make wines that could stand with the world’s greats. To do this, he knew he needed to grow fruit of unprecedented quality, with a level of concentration, complexity and balance never before seen in Argentina. Once each specific lot was identified and its potential revealed through row-by-row micro-vinification, Nicolás developed a plant-by-plant selection through which he could further enhance the characteristics of each lot. Today the Zapata vines are specifically marked and meticulously cared for as the mother plants to the Zapata Four: Nicolás Catena Zapata, Malbec Argentino, Adrianna Malbec and Nicasia Malbec.</p><p>Alejandro Vigil is a graduate in agricultural engineering from the Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias, where he went on to receive master’s degrees in both winemaking and irrigation management. He began his career in the National Agricultural Technology Institute, where he took over the Soil Analysis Department at the age of 28. Alejandro came to Bodega Catena Zapata in 2002 as head of Research &amp; Development. In 2003 he joined the enology department, becoming the manager of the top wines. His strong scientific background led to important developments in both vineyard management and winemaking. Alejandro was named chief winemaker in July 2007. A naturally restless person, Alejandro strives to channel his creative energy into pushing the limits of conventional viticultural and winemaking wisdom. Always ready to try something new, full of endless experiments, Alejandro’s goal is to constantly increase his understanding of the unique terroir in Mendoza’s high-altitude desert oasis.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Made at Bodegas Esmeralda, Tilia has been handcrafted to demonstrate true varietal character. The brand is named after the Tilia (Linden) tree commonly found throughout Argentina’s wine country. Vineyard workers often make tea from the flowers of this tree and enjoy time sitting in the shade after a hard day’s work. These wines are a tribute to those workers and to the Argentinean way of living life to the fullest, enjoying every moment and relaxing in the natural environment the land provides. These inviting selections are approachable, affordable and filled with layers of flavor.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Tilia wines offer a unique combination of fruit sourced from the traditional Eastern region and the dynamic Southern region of Mendoza. The Eastern region is one of the oldest and most recognized viticultural regions in Mendoza. It enjoys warm, sunny days and cool, desert nights. The fruit from this area offers ripe flavors and excellent mid-palate depth and concentration. The Southern region is considered to be one of the most premier growing areas in Mendoza. At 4,000 feet above sea level, the higher elevation offers much lower temperatures. This allows for more aromatic intensity and higher levels of natural acid creating freshness and balance in the wines. Grapes from this region have very intense aromas and bring a fresh characteristic to the wines. In addition to these general regions, Tilia’s Torrontes grapes are sourced from Cafayate, Salta in the Northwestern region.</p><p>Alejandro Viggiani is the winemaker and viticulturalist in charge of Tilia. Viggiani graduated with honors from the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in Mendoza with a degree in agricultural engineering. Continuing his education, he attended the viticulture and winemaking master’s program jointly held by the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo and the prestigious Eccie National Superieure Agronomique de Montpellier, where he specialized in vine physiology.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Tilia wines are aged in French and American oak, as well as stainless steel, and are allowed some time in bottle prior to release. They are produced in an approachable style using sustainably farmed grapes.</p>",

The small town of Lujan de Cuyo is on the northern banks of the Mendoza River, and it is from here that the viticultural area of the same name stretches south for roughly 20 miles (32.19 km) (32.19 km) (32.19 km) (32.19 km) (32.19 km) (32km) between the Andes Mountains in the west and the Lunlunta hills in the east.

              "description": "<p>In 1902, Nicola Catena, an Italian immigrant, planted his first vineyard in Mendoza, Argentina. The winery has remained under family control — now in its fourth generation — and is one of the few family-owned wine companies in Argentina that remains in Argentine hands. Owned today by Nicolás Catena and his daughter Laura, Bodega Catena Zapata is known as the pioneer of fine wine from Argentina, and Nicolás is recognized as the vintner who revolutionized wine quality in Argentina. A trained economist, Nicolás began this revolution in the early 1980s and continues to challenge himself and his team to make wines that can be counted among the best in the world. His measured approach to viticulture has taken its place in wine history as the pioneer of Malbec and high-altitude viticulture.</p><p>Catena wines, first launched in 1992, set a new standard for quality in South America. The wines immediately proved the quality potential of Argentina and garnered the first outstanding reviews for Argentine wines from worldwide media. After more than 20 years, the wines of Catena continue to lead the way in Argentine viticulture and winemaking. The family and the winery’s employees take great pride in carrying on the tradition that began over a century ago.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>The Catena family’s estate vineyards are located in the premier growing regions of Villa Bastías, Tupungato; Agrelo, Lujan de Cuyo; Lunlunta, Maipu; Gualtallary, Tupungato and La Consulta, San Carlos. Nicolás believes the terroir of Mendoza's high altitude wine country (3,000 - 5,000 feet above sea level) is unique to the world, and the reality of this belief is expressed in every bottle of Catena wine crafted.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Catena Classic - The Catena wines are made from 100% estate-grown fruit from the Catena family’s high-altitude vineyards. These wines are a blend of single varietals from various locations within these vineyard sites. Each vineyard is farmed in preparation for its role in the final blend, and each is harvested and vinified separately in order to preserve the unique expression, aromas and flavors of the fruit. This ultimately brings to the blend the strengths of each vineyard, adding a heightened complexity to the final wine.</p><p>Catena Alta - In the early 1990s, the Catena Alta wines set new standards for Argentine wine internationally, paving the way for a new category of high-end wines from Argentina. With these wines, Bodega Catena Zapata continued their pioneering efforts being the first to release Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay of this quality from Mendoza’s high-altitude wine country.</p><p>It is a truth among viticulturalists that every vineyard has a sweet spot: a series of rows, known as a lot, that produce better quality fruit. Differences in soil structure, clonal selection, row orientation, slope or plantation density result in a mix of wine character and concentration that gives the barrels from these rows a one-of-a-kind personality. The Catenas have spent the last 25 years extensively mapping their estate vineyards in order to discover these lots. The discovery and meticulous nurturing of these special rows gave birth to the Catena Alta wines. Each lot is farmed and vinified separately in order to showcase its unique expression. When brought together, each adds an individual element to the overall complexity of the final wine. Catena Alta is made from a limited production of single varietal wines from historic rows, or lots, in the Catena family’s high-altitude estate vineyards.</p><p>Catena Zapata - Even with the national acclaim of the Catena Alta wines, Nicolás still yearned to make wines that could stand with the world’s greats. To do this, he knew he needed to grow fruit of unprecedented quality, with a level of concentration, complexity and balance never before seen in Argentina. Once each specific lot was identified and its potential revealed through row-by-row micro-vinification, Nicolás developed a plant-by-plant selection through which he could further enhance the characteristics of each lot. Today the Zapata vines are specifically marked and meticulously cared for as the mother plants to the Zapata Four: Nicolás Catena Zapata, Malbec Argentino, Adrianna Malbec and Nicasia Malbec.</p><p>Alejandro Vigil is a graduate in agricultural engineering from the Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias, where he went on to receive master’s degrees in both winemaking and irrigation management. He began his career in the National Agricultural Technology Institute, where he took over the Soil Analysis Department at the age of 28. Alejandro came to Bodega Catena Zapata in 2002 as head of Research &amp; Development. In 2003 he joined the enology department, becoming the manager of the top wines. His strong scientific background led to important developments in both vineyard management and winemaking. Alejandro was named chief winemaker in July 2007. A naturally restless person, Alejandro strives to channel his creative energy into pushing the limits of conventional viticultural and winemaking wisdom. Always ready to try something new, full of endless experiments, Alejandro’s goal is to constantly increase his understanding of the unique terroir in Mendoza’s high-altitude desert oasis.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Made at Bodegas Esmeralda, Tilia has been handcrafted to demonstrate true varietal character. The brand is named after the Tilia (Linden) tree commonly found throughout Argentina’s wine country. Vineyard workers often make tea from the flowers of this tree and enjoy time sitting in the shade after a hard day’s work. These wines are a tribute to those workers and to the Argentinean way of living life to the fullest, enjoying every moment and relaxing in the natural environment the land provides. These inviting selections are approachable, affordable and filled with layers of flavor.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Tilia wines offer a unique combination of fruit sourced from the traditional Eastern region and the dynamic Southern region of Mendoza. The Eastern region is one of the oldest and most recognized viticultural regions in Mendoza. It enjoys warm, sunny days and cool, desert nights. The fruit from this area offers ripe flavors and excellent mid-palate depth and concentration. The Southern region is considered to be one of the most premier growing areas in Mendoza. At 4,000 feet above sea level, the higher elevation offers much lower temperatures. This allows for more aromatic intensity and higher levels of natural acid creating freshness and balance in the wines. Grapes from this region have very intense aromas and bring a fresh characteristic to the wines. In addition to these general regions, Tilia’s Torrontes grapes are sourced from Cafayate, Salta in the Northwestern region.</p><p>Alejandro Viggiani is the winemaker and viticulturalist in charge of Tilia. Viggiani graduated with honors from the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in Mendoza with a degree in agricultural engineering. Continuing his education, he attended the viticulture and winemaking master’s program jointly held by the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo and the prestigious Eccie National Superieure Agronomique de Montpellier, where he specialized in vine physiology.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Tilia wines are aged in French and American oak, as well as stainless steel, and are allowed some time in bottle prior to release. They are produced in an approachable style using sustainably farmed grapes.</p>",

              "description": "<p>El Enemigo translates as the enemy. Nodding to the fact that at the end of any journey, most remember only one battle — the one fought within (the original enemy). This is the battle that defines us. The wines of El Enemigo are a tribute to those internal battles that make us who we are, brought to fruition by a winemaker, Alejandro Vigil, and a historian, Adrianna Catena who share a love of wine and reach back in time to capture the era when European immigrants first settled in Argentina. These settlers sought to make wines as fine, and finer, than those of their old homeland. By 1936, Malbec and Petit Verdot were the most widely planted fine varietals in Argentina, their blend considered the ultimate in refinement and aging potential.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>El Enemigo is produced at Piedemonte al Sur, located in southern foothills of Luján de Cuyo, Mendoza. The facility is named for the unique aspect of Mendoza’s high-altitude winemaking region nestled in the foothills of the Andes Mountains.</p><p>Alejandro Vigil is a soil expert, a winemaker and an animal lover. He is the Chief Winemaker at Bodega Catena Zapata and the former head of the soil division at Argentina’s Wine Institute. Among his many pets, he keeps a cow to produce milk for donation to the local school children.</p><p>Adrianna Catena is the daughter of Nicolás&nbsp;Catena. She is a graduate student in Early Modern Spanish history at the University of Oxford, UK. Her dream is to continue the family legacy of winemaking, while pursuing a passion for history and writing from a cottage surrounded by vineyards in the Argentine Andes.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Founded by Patricio Reich, with the collaboration of world-renowned winemaker Alberto Antonini, Bodega Renacer prides itself in bringing consumers the very best wines from South America’s unique terroirs. The winery structure itself is quite impressive, featuring a medieval tower built of rocks with state-of-the-art winemaking equipment.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Renacer’s vineyards are located in Perdriel, a unique zone in Mendoza, Argentina, where the soil, altitude, climate and water come together to create the perfect growing environment for Malbec. In addition to Renacer’s more than 35 hectares of Malbec vines, the winery also purchases grapes from local producers in order to take advantage of Mendoza’s many terroirs — those in the Uco Valley, Lujan de Cuyo and Medrano. Vineyards used for Renacer’s bottlings are more than 50 years old and have very low yields.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Through hundreds of years of trial-and-error experimentation, French winemakers have recognized that certain areas within a single vineyard produce grapes with different characteristics than other areas within that same vineyard. Thus, fruit from different sections within one vineyard, farmed the same way, harvested at the same time by the same method, and produced into wine with the same technique, can be dramatically different. The soils play a significant role in these differences for each unique terroir within a vineyard.</p><p>Due to natural geological processes, soil properties can vary over distances as small as a few meters. Recognition of these small-scale variations within a vineyard can lead to wines that better reflect the terroir. Precision viticulture is an indispensable method to work the soil according to its true potential. Renacer determines these variations using digital maps obtained by Electromagnetic Conductivity Measures (ECM). The system registers 1,000 readings per hectare, which are then precisely stored and evaluated by computer and GPS to obtain their exact location within the vineyard. The result is a detailed map of the soil for precise vineyard optimization. This map allows Renacer to divide vineyards into homogeneous areas that are treated similarly in terms of irrigation and harvest time.</p><p>Born in Chile, Patricio Reich attended the Universidad de Chile in Santiago, where he earned a degree in industrial engineering. Eager to apply his engineering skills to the complicated mechanism of international business, he enrolled in the MBA program at the University of Chicago. Since graduating, he has applied his education and experience in a variety of roles, including working as a loan officer for the World Bank in Washington DC, and as an executive at the Santiago Chamber of Commerce. Patricio has also served as CEO and shareholder of companies in a wide variety of industries, including the finance, consumer electronics, airline and industrial commodities businesses.</p><p>After many years as a board member and shareholder at Viña San Pedro, Patricio decided to start his own wine business. With the assistance of Alberto Antonini of the wine-focused consulting firm Matura Group, Patricio founded Bodegas y Viñedos Renacer in the Mendoza region of Argentina.</p><p>The combination of Patricio’s passion for Mendoza’s wines and his extensive business experience has resulted in a modern and sophisticated winery that produces well-crafted, enjoyable wines that offer tremendous value. His wines have garnered praise from industry critics and publications worldwide, most notably Wine Spectator and Robert Parker’s Wine Advocate.</p>",

              "description": "<p>In 1902, Nicola Catena, an Italian immigrant, planted his first vineyard in Mendoza, Argentina. The winery has remained under family control — now in its fourth generation — and is one of the few family-owned wine companies in Argentina that remains in Argentine hands. Owned today by Nicolás Catena and his daughter Laura, Bodega Catena Zapata is known as the pioneer of fine wine from Argentina, and Nicolás is recognized as the vintner who revolutionized wine quality in Argentina. A trained economist, Nicolás began this revolution in the early 1980s and continues to challenge himself and his team to make wines that can be counted among the best in the world. His measured approach to viticulture has taken its place in wine history as the pioneer of Malbec and high-altitude viticulture.</p><p>Catena wines, first launched in 1992, set a new standard for quality in South America. The wines immediately proved the quality potential of Argentina and garnered the first outstanding reviews for Argentine wines from worldwide media. After more than 20 years, the wines of Catena continue to lead the way in Argentine viticulture and winemaking. The family and the winery’s employees take great pride in carrying on the tradition that began over a century ago.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>The Catena family’s estate vineyards are located in the premier growing regions of Villa Bastías, Tupungato; Agrelo, Lujan de Cuyo; Lunlunta, Maipu; Gualtallary, Tupungato and La Consulta, San Carlos. Nicolás believes the terroir of Mendoza's high altitude wine country (3,000 - 5,000 feet above sea level) is unique to the world, and the reality of this belief is expressed in every bottle of Catena wine crafted.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Catena Classic - The Catena wines are made from 100% estate-grown fruit from the Catena family’s high-altitude vineyards. These wines are a blend of single varietals from various locations within these vineyard sites. Each vineyard is farmed in preparation for its role in the final blend, and each is harvested and vinified separately in order to preserve the unique expression, aromas and flavors of the fruit. This ultimately brings to the blend the strengths of each vineyard, adding a heightened complexity to the final wine.</p><p>Catena Alta - In the early 1990s, the Catena Alta wines set new standards for Argentine wine internationally, paving the way for a new category of high-end wines from Argentina. With these wines, Bodega Catena Zapata continued their pioneering efforts being the first to release Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay of this quality from Mendoza’s high-altitude wine country.</p><p>It is a truth among viticulturalists that every vineyard has a sweet spot: a series of rows, known as a lot, that produce better quality fruit. Differences in soil structure, clonal selection, row orientation, slope or plantation density result in a mix of wine character and concentration that gives the barrels from these rows a one-of-a-kind personality. The Catenas have spent the last 25 years extensively mapping their estate vineyards in order to discover these lots. The discovery and meticulous nurturing of these special rows gave birth to the Catena Alta wines. Each lot is farmed and vinified separately in order to showcase its unique expression. When brought together, each adds an individual element to the overall complexity of the final wine. Catena Alta is made from a limited production of single varietal wines from historic rows, or lots, in the Catena family’s high-altitude estate vineyards.</p><p>Catena Zapata - Even with the national acclaim of the Catena Alta wines, Nicolás still yearned to make wines that could stand with the world’s greats. To do this, he knew he needed to grow fruit of unprecedented quality, with a level of concentration, complexity and balance never before seen in Argentina. Once each specific lot was identified and its potential revealed through row-by-row micro-vinification, Nicolás developed a plant-by-plant selection through which he could further enhance the characteristics of each lot. Today the Zapata vines are specifically marked and meticulously cared for as the mother plants to the Zapata Four: Nicolás Catena Zapata, Malbec Argentino, Adrianna Malbec and Nicasia Malbec.</p><p>Alejandro Vigil is a graduate in agricultural engineering from the Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias, where he went on to receive master’s degrees in both winemaking and irrigation management. He began his career in the National Agricultural Technology Institute, where he took over the Soil Analysis Department at the age of 28. Alejandro came to Bodega Catena Zapata in 2002 as head of Research &amp; Development. In 2003 he joined the enology department, becoming the manager of the top wines. His strong scientific background led to important developments in both vineyard management and winemaking. Alejandro was named chief winemaker in July 2007. A naturally restless person, Alejandro strives to channel his creative energy into pushing the limits of conventional viticultural and winemaking wisdom. Always ready to try something new, full of endless experiments, Alejandro’s goal is to constantly increase his understanding of the unique terroir in Mendoza’s high-altitude desert oasis.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Made at Bodegas Esmeralda, Tilia has been handcrafted to demonstrate true varietal character. The brand is named after the Tilia (Linden) tree commonly found throughout Argentina’s wine country. Vineyard workers often make tea from the flowers of this tree and enjoy time sitting in the shade after a hard day’s work. These wines are a tribute to those workers and to the Argentinean way of living life to the fullest, enjoying every moment and relaxing in the natural environment the land provides. These inviting selections are approachable, affordable and filled with layers of flavor.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Tilia wines offer a unique combination of fruit sourced from the traditional Eastern region and the dynamic Southern region of Mendoza. The Eastern region is one of the oldest and most recognized viticultural regions in Mendoza. It enjoys warm, sunny days and cool, desert nights. The fruit from this area offers ripe flavors and excellent mid-palate depth and concentration. The Southern region is considered to be one of the most premier growing areas in Mendoza. At 4,000 feet above sea level, the higher elevation offers much lower temperatures. This allows for more aromatic intensity and higher levels of natural acid creating freshness and balance in the wines. Grapes from this region have very intense aromas and bring a fresh characteristic to the wines. In addition to these general regions, Tilia’s Torrontes grapes are sourced from Cafayate, Salta in the Northwestern region.</p><p>Alejandro Viggiani is the winemaker and viticulturalist in charge of Tilia. Viggiani graduated with honors from the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in Mendoza with a degree in agricultural engineering. Continuing his education, he attended the viticulture and winemaking master’s program jointly held by the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo and the prestigious Eccie National Superieure Agronomique de Montpellier, where he specialized in vine physiology.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Tilia wines are aged in French and American oak, as well as stainless steel, and are allowed some time in bottle prior to release. They are produced in an approachable style using sustainably farmed grapes.</p>",

This is the battle that defines us. The wines of El Enemigo are a tribute to those internal battles that make us who we are, brought to fruition by a winemaker, Alejandro Vigil, and a historian, Adrianna Catena who share a love of wine and reach back in time to capture the era when European immigrants first settled in Argentina. These settlers sought to make wines as fine, and finer, than those of their old homeland. By 1936, Malbec and Petit Verdot were the most widely planted fine varietals in Argentina, their blend considered the ultimate in refinement and aging potential.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>El Enemigo is produced at Piedemonte al Sur, located in southern foothills of Luján de Cuyo, Mendoza. The facility is named for the unique aspect of Mendoza’s high-altitude winemaking region nestled in the foothills of the Andes Mountains.</p><p>Alejandro Vigil is a soil expert, a winemaker and an animal lover. He is the Chief Winemaker at Bodega Catena Zapata and the former head of the soil division at Argentina’s Wine Institute. Among his many pets, he keeps a cow to produce milk for donation to the local school children.</p><p>Adrianna Catena is the daughter of Nicolás&nbsp;Catena. She is a graduate student in Early Modern Spanish history at the University of Oxford, UK. Her dream is to continue the family legacy of winemaking, while pursuing a passion for history and writing from a cottage surrounded by vineyards in the Argentine Andes.</p>",

Low humidity and dry, sandy soil with excellent drainage provides the fruit with a slow and balanced ripening cycle, resulting in balanced acidity and concentrated flavors. These conditions also protect the vines against disease and provide a long, dry season for low yields of small grapes, concentrated in flavor, color and tannins. Vista del Sur was designed from vine to bottle to enhance the quality of the wine it produces. The winery is one of the few facilities utilizing specially designed small tronco-conic tanks, and the only winery to produce all of its wine exclusively with these tanks.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Leopoldo Kuschnaroff hails from a family of farmers, born of Ukrainian immigrants to Argentina. A true son of the Mendoza wine region, he graduated trade school with a degree in winemaking in 1999, followed by a master’s degree in viticulture from the prestigious Cuyo University. His prime philosophy and goal as a winemaker is to make wines reflective of the&nbsp;terroir, a challenge which enables him to experiment with the different microclimates of the Uco Valley, perfecting wine that is truly representative of this region. Leopoldo has been working with the Catena family since 2007, joining the prestigious High Note brand in 2013.</p>",

Along with parts of Provence, these are considered to be France’s oldest vineyards. The region is known for medium- to full-bodied reds, dry rosés, dry and sparkling white wines and sweet red and white wines. It is home to numerous grape varieties including Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. The traditional Rhône grapes of Mourvedre, Grenache, Syrah and Viognier are also prominent here.&nbsp;</p>",

              "description": "<p>Good friends Tierry (renowned French winemaker) and Guy (British wine industry rebel) created FAT bastard almost by accident. It started out as an experiment Thierry had going in the back of his cellar, leaving a barrel “on the lees” (yeast cells). He didn’t know what to expect, but when he and Guy tried the wine, Thierry exclaimed, with a strong French accent, ”Now zat iz what you call eh Phet bast-ard!” This very British expression perfectly described the wine’s wonderful color and round, rich palate, so that’s what they named it. In 1991, Véronique Torcolacci obtained her degree in oenology from the University of Toulouse. She joined Gabriel Meffre as oenologist in charge of quality before becoming head winemaker.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Produced in partnership with Gabriel Meffre and crafted from the low-yielding vineyards of the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France, the wine is remarkably full bodied with a vibrant, fruit-forward style. It is no wonder that Time magazine has referred to FAT bastard as, “Wine for the anti-snob.”</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>When crafting FAT bastard, the objective of Véronique and her team remains the same: never make the slightest compromise on quality. With this in mind, she regularly visits the Languedoc vineyards, meeting with the winegrowers and seeking out wines that satisfy her rigorous demands.</p><p>As someone who feels strongly about protecting the environment, Véronique raises the issue of sustainable development with winegrowers and always strives to respect the land and the grape varieties as much as possible during the winemaking process. Commitment and passion are the driving forces that have enabled her to rise to this challenge for the past 20 years. Thanks to her unique knowledge, she has obtained more than 100 medals, several 4- and 5-star ratings, and special mentions for her wines in all the major wine competitions and top wine magazines. Her skills have also made her a name throughout the profession, particularly in the area of wine bottle capping and corking.</p>",

Along with parts of Provence, these are considered to be France’s oldest vineyards. The region is home to numerous grape varieties, including many international varieties like Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. The traditional Rhône grapes of Mourvedre, Grenache, Syrah and Viognier are also prominent.&nbsp;</p>",

              "description": "<p>Good friends Tierry (renowned French winemaker) and Guy (British wine industry rebel) created FAT bastard almost by accident. It started out as an experiment Thierry had going in the back of his cellar, leaving a barrel “on the lees” (yeast cells). He didn’t know what to expect, but when he and Guy tried the wine, Thierry exclaimed, with a strong French accent, ”Now zat iz what you call eh Phet bast-ard!” This very British expression perfectly described the wine’s wonderful color and round, rich palate, so that’s what they named it. In 1991, Véronique Torcolacci obtained her degree in oenology from the University of Toulouse. She joined Gabriel Meffre as oenologist in charge of quality before becoming head winemaker.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Produced in partnership with Gabriel Meffre and crafted from the low-yielding vineyards of the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France, the wine is remarkably full bodied with a vibrant, fruit-forward style. It is no wonder that Time magazine has referred to FAT bastard as, “Wine for the anti-snob.”</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>When crafting FAT bastard, the objective of Véronique and her team remains the same: never make the slightest compromise on quality. With this in mind, she regularly visits the Languedoc vineyards, meeting with the winegrowers and seeking out wines that satisfy her rigorous demands.</p><p>As someone who feels strongly about protecting the environment, Véronique raises the issue of sustainable development with winegrowers and always strives to respect the land and the grape varieties as much as possible during the winemaking process. Commitment and passion are the driving forces that have enabled her to rise to this challenge for the past 20 years. Thanks to her unique knowledge, she has obtained more than 100 medals, several 4- and 5-star ratings, and special mentions for her wines in all the major wine competitions and top wine magazines. Her skills have also made her a name throughout the profession, particularly in the area of wine bottle capping and corking.</p>",

As a testament to his pedigree in the industry, Jorge also serves as director and head winemaker.</p><p><br></p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>This sprawling property in the heart of the Douro’s Cima Corgo consists of two different vineyards: Quinta do Passadouro and Quinta do Sibio. Both vineyards boast a range of indigenous varieties native to the Douro, including Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz, Sousão and Tinta Barroca.</p><p><br></p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>The Passadouro vineyard has roots with the Niepoort Port house, where it used to supply grapes for their renowned Quinta do Passadouro Niepoort Vintage Port. Today, winemaker/owner Jorge Serôdio Borges focuses on making top-level dry and unfortified wines from the same vineyard. Natural farming is prioritized, and no chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides are used. Irrigation is minimal and performed only by hand, and indigenous yeasts are used for almost all fermentation. Organic certification by Sativa is pending.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the steep grade of the slopes where the vineyards are planted and the narrow width of the terraces, all grapes must be picked by hand. Traditional foot-treading in granite lagares is often employed, which yields fine, silky tannins since the process is so gentle on the grapes. The wines are all aged in French barriques.</p><p><br></p><p>Borges’s early experience includes working as an oenologist at Niepoort. Now, in addition to owning Quinta do Passadouro, he is and his wife, Sandra Tavares da Silva (also an oenologist) own the winery Wine &amp; Soul. Sandra, who has the distinction of being the Douro's first female winemaker, gained her experience at Quinta do Vale D.

              "description": "<p>The name Duorum, which is Latin for “from two,” captures the spirit of this famed Portuguese winery, which was founded in 2007 by João Portugal Ramos and José Soares Franco, two of Portugal’s most renowned oenologists. Ramos, widely considered the \"King of the Alentejo,\" began his career as a groundbreaking wine consultant in the 1980s, and today runs successful projects in the Alentejo, Vinho Verde, Beiras, and Douro. Franco, on the other hand, spent 27 years as wine director for one of Portugal's most renowned wines: the Douro's Barca Velha. Longtime friends and admirers of each other’s work, they sought to pool their combined 60 years of winemaking experience and create a wine together. Today, Duorum is widely recognized as a gold standard for Portuguese wines.</p><h2>Location of Vineyard</h2><p>Duorum has vineyards in the Douro’s mountainous, schistose Cima Corga, and its arid Douro Superior. The microclimates and terroir in these subregions are quite different, which brings together grapes of varied characteristics. This unique blend creates a layered, complex wine.</p><h2>Winemaking Philosophy</h2><p>Duroum is founded on the principle of celebrating the Douro region’s unique terroir and winemaking heritage. Only native Portuguese grape varieties are planted in the hard, schistose soil of the Duorum vineyards. The mountains in the area are so steep that vines are planted in terraces overlooking the winding Douro River far below. The landscape is made even more breathtaking by the abundance of native olive trees and indigenous wildlife, such as the endangered Bonelli’s Eagle. A deeply felt ethic of sustainability and stewardship toward the land drives Duorum. Their use of native flora and the character it adds to their wine has placed them in high regard. In fact, in 2012 Duorum received the European Union’s Business &amp; Biodiversity award for its outstanding achievements in halting biodiversity loss and supporting natural ecosystems.</p><p>Internationally acclaimed oenologists João Portugal Ramos and José Soares Franco graduated from El Instituto Superior de Agronomia (Higher Institute of Agronomy) in 1977 with degrees in agronomy. Both gentlemen received work placements at the National Winegrowing Station at Dois Portos from 1977 to 1978. In the 30 years that followed, João and José have left an indelible mark on the industry, both domestically and internationally. With more than three generations of winemaking history between their families, they chose to combine their superior skills and passion for winemaking and founded Duorum in 2007.</p>",

The Quinta covers nearly 100 acres, with only 25 reserved for vines. It was always clear to the Nicolau de Almeida family that maintaining the biodiversity of the&nbsp;<em>terroir&nbsp;</em>was of fundamental importance, as much for the vines themselves as for the region. “We are part of a whole, and it is in that whole that we sought to integrate our project.” For this reason, they choose to work in organic farming, utilizing principles of biodynamic agriculture. The steep hill in the Quinta do Monte Xisto vineyard is comprised of schist; this provides an optimal home to their vines, which in order to survive, must drive their roots deep into the ground, searching for a regular source of water. It is, however, this very struggle for survival that causes the vine to produce grapes with strong and unique personalities.&nbsp;</p><p>João Nicolau de Almeida was a pioneer in vertical plantation in Douro, as well as in the study of the grape varieties. The family opted for this planting technique, which allows for the optimization of various levels of exposure and altitudes, in order to permit a blend of warmer and cooler zones. The selection of the varieties was not only based on a knowledge acquired over many years, but also on the diversity afforded by the land and on the principle of absolute respect for the culture and&nbsp;<em>terroir&nbsp;</em>of Douro Superior.&nbsp;</p>",

The Minho River is its northern border, forming part of the border with Spain; its southern border is formed by the Douro River and the Freita, Arada and Montemuro mountains. To the east, it’s bordered by the mountains of Peneda, Gerês, Cabreira and Marão, and the western border is the Atlantic Ocean. In terms of geographical area, it is the largest Portuguese demarcated region, and one of the largest in Europe. The natural conditions of this region are ideal for the production of excellent white wines. Topographically, the region is a vast amphitheater which, starting at the coast, gradually climbs in elevation towards the interior, exposing the entire area to the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. It’s a phenomenon reinforced by the orientation of the valleys of the main rivers, which run east to west and facilitate penetration of the sea winds. This Atlantic influence, mostly granitic soils, mild climate and high rainfall, are reflected in the freshness, lightness and elegance of the wines of this region.</p>",

Cool, brisk air graces the vineyards at nightfall, encouraging elevated levels of natural acidity, while the soils impart a refined mineral character to the final wines: a combination that is unmistakably Dão. The trio aims to utilize an organic approach in the vineyards and hone their skills together, as a team, to create wines with true varietal character, unassailable elegance, and a compelling presence that would be difficult to refuse.</span></p>",

              "description": "<p>Foz de Arouce has a long history of winemaking that can be linked to the legend of the Arab King Arunce, who built a castle in the region to protect his daughter, his treasures, and, of course, his wine. Today, the fourth Count of Arouce, João Filipe Osorio, lives nearby in his 16th century family home, overseeing one of the most consistently top-rated estates in Portugal – Foz de Arouce.</p><p>The estate has a rich history: A Roman road runs through the vineyard, and it was the site of the 1811 Napoleonic Battle of Foz de Arouce. In 1939, a tornado destroyed the pine forest that had covered the land and the family took this opportunity to repopulate the area with vines. Some of the original 70-year-old vines still produce fruit today. The estate is the definition of unique terroir – not another vineyard is to be found in a 50-mile radius.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Conde de Foz de Arouce is located in the Lousã Municipality, near the city of Coimbra, in the region of Beira Âtlantico. The estate comprises 150 acres of vineyard on schist and quartz soils. The vines are planted on a steep mountain that faces the sun and is bathed in fog each morning, a crucial component to preserving freshness in the wine. Surrounded by windmill-topped mountains, the vineyard is protected from the strong Tejo winds.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>The vineyard is planted primarily with Baga, though many other traditional Portuguese varieties are included. Wine production is limited to around 10,000 bottles of red and 1,500 bottles of white each year. A focus on terroir is emphasized, producing some truly unique wines, as Foz de Arouce is the only vineyard in a 50-mile radius. Top Portuguese oenologist João Portugal Ramos has married into the family and helped lift Foz de Arouce’s wines to Portugal’s uppermost echelon.</p><p>Born to a family with a long history of wine production, internationally acclaimed oenologist João Portugal Ramos was awarded a degree in agronomy from El Instituto Superior de Agronomia (Higher Institute of Agronomy) in 1977. After receiving a work placement at the National Winegrowing Station at Dois Portos from 1977 to 1978, he embarked on a career as an oenologist. As a consultant, he has played a significant role in the development of some of Portugal’s most notable wines. These successes have won him many awards and accolades throughout his career and brought him national and international acclaim as one of the main figures responsible for the development of Portuguese wines during the last 20 years.</p>",

Before he began making his own wines, he was a pioneering wine consultant widely considered Portugal’s Pierro Antinori or Emile Peynaud (The New York Times). His many accolades include winning 2010 Personality of the Year and 2006 Producer of the Year (Essencia do Vinho); 2010 Viticulture Team of the Year, 2000 Winemaker of the Year, and 1998 Company of the Year (Revista de Vinhos); 1999 &amp; 2004 Winemaker of the Year and 2004 Producer of the Year (Vin &amp; Mat, Sweden); 2004 Newcomer of the Year (Wein Gourmet, Germany); and the 2008 Prize for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture).</p><p>In the decades that Ramos has consulted, he almost single-handedly opened Portuguese winemaking to the benefits of modern technologies with an emphasis on low yields, occasional oak aging, and the preservation of a grape’s natural fruit flavors. In 1990, he decided it was time to start creating his own wine and he began planting vineyards in Alentejo around his new winery, Vila Santa.</p><h2>Location of Vineyard</h2><p>J. Portugal Ramos’s 1250 acres of vineyard are located near the ancient marble-filled town of Estremoz in Alentejo. The schist and limestone-clay soil, combined with the region’s Continental climate, create ideal conditions for growing grapes.</p><p>Ramos’s wines quickly met critical acclaim, and he expanded his vineyards to select locations in Tejo, Beiras and the Douro. His most recent project is a crisp, fruity Vinho Verde called Lima, in tribute to the iconic river that runs through the region. Lima is a welcome addition to Ramos’s collection, each member of which can be identified by a signature insistence on quality, balance and expression of terroir.</p><h2>Winemaking Philosophy</h2><p>Ramos draws from his decades of experience to carefully create a range of wines. Depending on the provenance and variety of the grape, Ramos employs temperature-controlled vinification in steel tanks or traditional foot-treading in marble lagares, followed by aging in barrique to add richness of character. For all his wines, he employs advanced quality-control systems that have set the standard in Portugal.</p><p>Born to a family with a long history of wine production, internationally acclaimed oenologist João Portugal Ramos was awarded a degree in agronomy from El Instituto Superior de Agronomia (Higher Institute of Agronomy) in 1977. After receiving a work placement at the National Winegrowing Station at Dois Portos from 1977 to 1978, he embarked on a career as an oenologist.

              "description": "<p>Quinta das Arcas, which produces Conde Villar and Tapada de Villar wines, is a family owned winery that was founded in 1985 by Antonio Esteves Monteiro. The family owns significant vineyard holdings in both the DOC Vinho Verde (Minho) as well as DOC Alentejo. In the Vinho Verde region where the company is headquartered, the production is obtained from three estates, totaling more than 295 acres (120 hectares) of vineyardS. Further south, in Alentejo, the winery’s holdings included 150 acres (60 hectares) of vineyards with Portuguese and international varieties highly adapted to the region and also 75 acres (30 hectares) of olive trees. The winery also engages in cheese-making from cow’s milk produced on the estate.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Conde Villar, the Vinho Verde wines, are produced in northwest Portugal, on the Spanish border. The vineyards here are influenced by a very special microclimate formed in the valley of the Ferreira River, which along with cool Atlantic breezes lowers the temperature, particularly toward the end of the growing cycle. The vineyards are located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the ocean, at an average of 490 feet (150 meters) high. The Vinho Verde vineyards are planted on schist, black slate, and granite. The average age of these vineyards is about 20 years, and no irrigation is used after the first few years to develop healthy roots. The wines produced in the Alentejo are about 250 miles (400 km) south of the Vinho Verde region, inland from the ocean. The vineyards are planted on clay and schist soils. The location is favorable to wine growing, benefitting from outstanding sun exposure and severe temperature shifts between day and night. The winery is located in the middle of the vineyard, making a quick trip for the grapes from vine to crush. The climate is very hot and very dry, with temperatures rising to about 100°F (38°C) at harvest. The average age of the vines is 12 years.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Conde Villar and Tapada de Villar wines are produced with the finest quality grapes from the Vinho Verde and Alentejo regions, with careful attention paid to the treatment of the land. All grapes are grown under the EPA’s Integrated Pest Management system, eliminating pests using only natural methods. For the vineyards located in the Vinho Verde region of the country, the grapes are manually harvested, transported in small crates, and vinified in a short period in order to preserve the primary aromas and freshness. The fruit is quickly destemmed and pressed, followed by low temperature fermentation on the white wines and carbonic maceration on the reds. The rosé wine production effectively uses the same method as the white wine, but with a small amount of skin contact and strict temperature control. In the Alentejo, the harvest is mechanical. This allows the teams to work during the night and part of the morning in order to avoid the high temperatures that scorch the region during the harvest season. The winery’s location in the middle of the vineyards allows the team to vinify the fruit shortly after the harvest. All the grapes are destemmed upon entering the winery.</p>",

In 2000, the new plantings had reached optimal maturity when Sandra Tavares, the youngest daughter made her first debut as a winemaker, passionate and eager to produce wine with only the best grapes found on the estate.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Quinta de Chocapalha is nestled between the sun-bathed hills surrounding Alenquer, just northwest of Lisbon.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Drawing from traditional and modern winemaking influences, Quinta de Chocapalha vinifies in traditional lagares yet employs the use of a mechanical treaders during fermentation; this fine-tuned winemaking philosophy shines through in the wines, which boast both traditional minerality and elegance, while remaining fresh and fruit forward in essence.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Quinta do Monte d’Oiro (“Hill of Gold”) was founded by winemaker José Bento dos Santo in 1990. His goal was to develop top-quality wines in a European style while respecting his vineyard’s unique terroir. The wines, which are deep, mineral and personalized, carry the Quinta’s identity, and their unique robust character is a harmonious match with classical and haute cuisines.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, Quinta do Monte d’Oiro has achieved international renown, with wines chosen for the Portuguese president’s cellar at the Palácio de Belém, and available at some of the best European and American restaurants, such as the Alain Ducasse Group and the Four Seasons Hotel. Additionally, Monte d’Oiro’s Homenagem a António Carqueijeriro 1999, a wine produced as an homage to a great friend of Bento dos Santos, won an Iberian blind-tasting contest of the best 30 wines from Portugal and Spain. This same wine was part of Madrid’s ”Mythical Wines of the World“ tasting in 2003 and 2004, along with the legendary wines Petrus, Cheval Blanc, Beaucastel, Grange, Vega Sicilia, and Pingus.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Quinta do Monte d’Oiro is located in Estremadura, Alenquer, 30 miles north of Lisbon. The area has been praised in various documents dating as far back as the 17th century as a privileged terroir that produces great wines.</p><p>The 105-acre vineyard is dedicated to the red grapes Syrah, Cinsaut, Petit Verdot, Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz; Viognier is its only white grape. The climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence, and the soil composition is clay-limestone.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Strict guidelines and procedures are followed during the production process, which is assisted by Grégory Viennois (Maison M. Chapoutier’s head winemaker). The vineyard is manicured to achieve production in small quantities with very low yields (about 1.5 to 2.6 tons per acre), and grapes are carefully handpicked into 33-pound boxes. Fermentation is rigorously run in temperature-controlled stainless steel vats; long maceration is employed and extended aging occurs in the best new French oak barrels such as Seguin Moreau, Radoux and Taransaud.</p><p>José Bento dos Santos is an industrial chemical engineer with an international career as a successful metal broker. His early passion for wine saw him create one the finest cellars in Iberia, which included three decades of purchases from Christie’s and Sotheby’s. In the early 1990s, he decided to turn his passion into his profession, launching the ambitious project of producing world-class wines at Quinta do Monte d’Oiro.</p><p>Hand in hand with his love of wine is his interest in gastronomy. Bentos dos Santos is vice-chairman of the International Academy of Gastronomy; gastronomic counsellor of the Chaîne des Rôtisseurs; and member of the Psychologues du Goût Academy. He is also one of the Entonneurs Rabelaisiens and a Chevalier du Tastevin.</p><p>He was awarded the Commander grade of the Order of Agricultural Merit in 2006 by the president of Portugal and was decorated in 2007 by the French Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Bentos dos Santos contributes regularly to leading Portuguese and international publications as well as to conferences and seminars such as the “City Tastings” program at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. He has also created and presented two 13-episode TV programs about food and wine: “Wine Secrets” (2004) and “Taste Sense” (2007).</p>",

The name “Valdeorras” means Valley of Gold, and the fertile alluvial soil in the river valleys provide a hospitable home for vineyards. As Galicia's most inland region, Valdeorras has a predominantly Continental climate. Valdeorras is known for its unique and complex Godello wines, which provide varietal characters of citrus fruit, herbs and mineral/earthy notes. Less prominent, but appealing in its own right, Mencía forms the basis of most of the red wines produced here. It displays rich, fruity characters and can appear as varietally or blended, often with Garnacha. “Valdeorras Superior” can be used on labels for quality wines which contain at least 80% Godello or Mencía.&nbsp;</p>",

Its vineyards are in the foothills of the Iberian Mountain Range near the Ebro River, in the northern part of the province of Zaragoza.

Borsao originated as a brand in 1958 when the cooperative of Borja was founded.&nbsp;In 2001, the cooperatives Ponzuelo and Tabuenca joined Borja, and Bodegas Borsao S.A. was established, bringing reform and a new sense of prestige to the winemaking practices of the group.&nbsp;The mission of Bodegas Borsao is to establish their wines as the benchmark for premium Garnacha wines around the world.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Campo de Borja D.O. is located in the Aragon region,&nbsp;nestled against the Pyrenées Mountains. Bodegas&nbsp;Borsao&nbsp;stretches&nbsp;over&nbsp;2,260&nbsp;hectares&nbsp;belonging&nbsp;to&nbsp;some&nbsp;375&nbsp;vine-growers. The&nbsp;hillsides&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Moncayo shelter&nbsp;the&nbsp;vineyards&nbsp;located&nbsp;between&nbsp;350&nbsp;and&nbsp;800&nbsp;metres&nbsp;of&nbsp;altitude, regulating&nbsp;cold,&nbsp;heat&nbsp;and&nbsp;moderating&nbsp;the&nbsp;effects&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;North-west&nbsp;'Cierzo', or wind. This region is historically and geographically conducive to growing Garnacha, which makes up 60% of the vineyards. Other varietals include, Syrah, Tempranillo, Cabernet&nbsp;Sauvignon, and minimal amounts of Mazuela,&nbsp;Macabeo,&nbsp;and Chardonnay.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Winemaking techniques aim to preserve the characteristics of Garnacha from the region at all price points and quality levels. Harvest&nbsp;is&nbsp;carried&nbsp;out&nbsp;manually&nbsp;in key&nbsp;vineyards, and transported&nbsp;in&nbsp;20-kg&nbsp;cases. The winery&nbsp;uses&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;1&nbsp;million&nbsp;frigories&nbsp;cooling&nbsp;capacity to&nbsp;preserve&nbsp;the&nbsp;characteristics&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;fruit. Oak is used moderately to tame and add complexity to the wines, rather than impose its presence on them. The use of oak is adapted to the final style of the wine: different origins, both new and used wood and different sizes help to round up the expression of our wines.</p>",

It was founded in 2002 with the aim of turning it into a world reference for Garnacha wines of the highest quality, crafted from some of the oldest native vine clones in the area.The garnacha grape is one of the varieties that best expresses its terroir. Thus, the Garnacha of Alto Moncayo is different from the rest of the Campo de Borja D.O area. This is due to the very strict selection made from the vineyards, the type of soil in which it is grown, the microclimate, and the age of the vines.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Located in Borja- the heart of the Campo de Borja DO . Vines are planted at the foothills of El Moncayo which is the highest point in the Iberian Mountain Range (2,315 m) and the winery's namesake. The region experiences a continental climate with&nbsp;hot&nbsp;summers&nbsp;and&nbsp;cold&nbsp;winters.&nbsp;Vineyards are planted on very&nbsp;unique&nbsp;soils&nbsp;of&nbsp;red&nbsp;clay&nbsp;(indicative&nbsp;of&nbsp;being&nbsp;rich&nbsp;in&nbsp;iron)&nbsp;mixed&nbsp;with&nbsp;red&nbsp;slate, and because&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;hillside&nbsp;location are shallow and nutrient-deficient.&nbsp;</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>The Garnacha grapes of Alto Moncayo undergo very strict vineyard selection, from vines planted as far back as the early 1900's through the 1970's. Only&nbsp;the&nbsp;most&nbsp;perfectly&nbsp;mature clusters&nbsp;are selected and carried in small crates to prevent crushing, where they are further sorted and selected at triage tables. Wines undergo malolactic fermentation in both French &amp; American oak, and aged in new barrels between anywhere from 16-24 months.&nbsp;These practices, in combination with the unique microclimate of the area ensure superior quality Garnacha that is distinct from any other in the Campo de Borja D.O.</p>",

The wines are made by Raquel Acebes, who has worked at the winery since 2003. To create a home for Convento San Francisco’s winery, the owners restored a 13th-century monastery in the fortress town of Peñafiel. The building’s fastidiously preserved historic walls and structural details make it an architectural treasure, one that belies the modern workings within.</p><p>Convento San Francisco also owns the artisanal Aldeasoña project, which produces one wine per year from Tinto del País, the local name for Tempranillo. The grapes are sourced from ungrafted, pre-phylloxera vines over 95 years old located in several vineyard sites in and around Ribera del Duero. Rather than follow the rules prescribed by the DO, Aldeasoña takes the regional designation of Vino de la Tierra Castilla y León.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Convento San Francisco’s grapes are sourced from 46 different plots in Ribera del Duero. These sites have been carefully selected so as to balance the region's three predominant soil types. In Olivares del Duero and Quintanilla de Arriba, the soils are calcareous. In Peñafiel, the soils become sandier. Farther east, near Burgos (Gumiel de Mercado), the sites are at their highest elevations and the soils are sandy with alluvial and marl components. Each site is selected for its altitude, latitude, and soil composition. The vineyards contain old vines ranging from 20 to 102 years of age, 50% of which are pre-phylloxera.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Convento San Francisco is a blend of 90% Tinto Fino (Tempranillo) and 10% Merlot. The wine is fermented in very small stainless steel vats and then aged in French and American barrels for a minimum of 12 months. Convento San Francisco is devoted to perfecting the expression of old vine Tempranillo, and in most years the winery produces just one wine.</p><p>Raquel Acebes Peña is the Wine Director at Convento San Francisco. She has been with the winery since 2003, where she began as the Laboratory Manager. Prior to that, Raquel help oenological positions at Legaris and Pago de Carraovejas in Ribera del Duero as well as at Marques de Riscal in Rueda.</p><p>Raquel studied at the University of Valladolid, where she received her degree in agricultural engineering in 1997. In the ensuing two years she researched and published a paper in the Spanish Society of Phytopathology on the characterization of Rhizoctonia solani, for which she won the award for best thesis. Two years later she returned to the university and received her degree in oenology.</p>",

Planted in 2002, Finca Montepedroso is a 62-acre single-estate vineyard at an altitude of 2,500 feet. The family vinifies their Verdejo in a small yet modern winery on the estate, continuing their tradition of producing family-owned estate wines.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>The family chose to make Verdejo in the DO of Rueda rather than in another region such as La Mancha due to Rueda’s particular terroir. Despite its Continental climate, Rueda’s high-altitude vineyards and gravelly, nutrient-poor soil create an ideal environment for preserving acidity and producing fresh and complex whites. Finca Montepedroso is located about a mile north of the town of Rueda.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>La Familia Martínez Bujanda is committed to making wine from their own high-altitude old-vine vineyards in Spain’s best wine regions.

In 1996, Benjamin made the first vintage of his “La Cueva del Contador” wine and started to buy vineyards for his plan to become a “bodeguero”—a wine producer. Benjamin was the winemaker at Aratadi from 1985 to 2000, where he was able to apply his skill and continue to hone his craft. In 1999, he made the first vintage of “Contador” from vineyards he acquired.</p><p>In 2000, after seeing these first wines favorably received by the market and press, Benjamin dedicated himself full time to his personal project. Robert Parker’s Wine Advocate awarded 100 points to the 2004 and 2005 vintages of Contador made in his parents’ garage.</p><p>In collaboration with the architect Hector Herrera, Benjamin designed and opened a new winery in June 2008, to coincide with the summer solstice. The three floors or terraces mirror the original slopes of the site where it is located, enabling both fruit and wine to be moved by gravity.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>The wines are sourced from sixty-two different plots which are organically farmed.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>The wineries carries out green harvesting in May and June, and harvest in September by hand with grapes carefully placed in 14-16 kilo bins. The maximum amount of time the fruit sits in the bins is half an hour. Fermentation is temperature controlled in 10,000-litre truncated conical French oak vessels, and racking of the wine is done during a waning moon when the gravitational pull keeps the heavier particles at the bottom of the barrel allowing for greater clarity in the wine.</p><p>There is a holistic approach to the vine, so the winery uses fertilizers only in certain years with organic material composed by Bodega Contador viticulturists themselves from sheep manure. They apply herbal treatments that create an ambient environment for the vines to thrive, and treat the vines with copper sulfate when needed.</p><p>Benjamin oversees every aspect from vine to wine, including traveling to France to select the best oak trees for barrels and choosing the best-quality Spanish corks from high altitude mountain regions in Castellon, Toledo, and Gerona. As the son, grandson and great-grandson of winemakers, Benjamin uses rigorous attention to detail to produce wines of great and noble character</p>",

More than a century has passed since the family’s patriarch, Joaquín Martínez-Bujanda, began making wine in 1889; now his great-grandchildren, Carlos and Pilar, are carrying on the tradition. They realized their dream of fully expressing wine from a single vineyard by opening Finca Valpiedra in 1999.</p><p>As a testament to the quality of Finca Valpiedra’s wine, the estate has been inducted into the exclusive organization Grandes Pagos de España. The group’s mission is to defend and propagate the culture of “Pago” wine, meaning wine produced in a specific terroir that reflects the distinct personality of the soil and climate. To become a member, a vineyard must surpass strict quality standards and also exhibit a degree of uniqueness in terms of soil, climate or grape variety that sets it apart from the surrounding area. The association’s membership includes 25 estate wineries throughout Spain.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Located in the Rioja Alta section of DOCa Rioja, the estate is nestled into a sharp meander in the Ebro River, providing a microclimate and terroir unlike anywhere else in the region. The vineyard is comprised of 80 hectares divided into 9 plots of loam and limestone soil. The soil contains a multitude of pebbles from the river, which gives Finca Valpiedra its name (“Stone Valley”). The stones also contribute to the land’s natural ability to trap heat and accelerate grape ripening. Finca Valpiedra’s soil is high in calcium, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, copper and iron, all of which contribute to its acidity and fertility.</p><p>Located at an altitude of approximately 1400 feet above sea level, the climate is Atlantic-Mediterranean with hot summer days and cool nights, ideal for full grape ripening while maintaining freshness. The vineyard is protected from the cold northern winds by the surrounding Sierra de Cantabria Mountains. Its unique microclimate provides an optimal amount of sunshine and rain (nearly 16 to 19 inches per year).</p><p>The primary variety grown in Finca Valpiedra is Tempranillo, with some land dedicated to Mazuelo, Graciano and Cabernet Sauvignon. The average vine age is 35 years, and all grapes are hand-harvested and sorted.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Although the 21st century has heralded modernization and automation in winemaking, the mission of the Familia Martínez Bujanda has always remained true to the original intent of Joaquín Martínez Bujanda from over a century ago – control of the vineyard is essential to making wine. Each generation has sought to best utilize each location, taking into account the altitude, microclimate, soil, and the characteristic unique to each terroir, to create wines that capture its essence. The vineyards are nourished with organic matter and employ modern and traditional winemaking techniques to produce the best-quality wine possible from each parcel. The goal at Finca Valpiedra is to produce innovative wine that will flourish into the next century, while adhering to time-honored traditions. The results are wines of elegance, style and sophistication.</p>",

Indigenous yeasts are used, and insecticides, herbicides and fertilizers are avoided in favor of biodynamic practices. Pepe also emphasizes placing his vines under the optimal level of hydric stress to produce small, concentrated grapes; he uses computerized sensors to monitors moisture levels in the vineyard, adjusting irrigation accordingly.</p><p>José (Pepe) Enrique Mendoza Gracia has been participating in wine production from a young age, helping with harvest and grape pressing (using a 300-year-old, Roman-style wine press) at Bodegas Enrique Mendoza. After declaring his vocation of oenology in secondary school, Pepe continued his studies at the Félix Jiménez de Requena School of Viticulture and Enology, and carried out his practicum with the Raimat and Masia Bach group. He was the first Spanish winemaker to work in New Zealand, where he worked Grove Mill in Marlborough Valley. He later worked in Argentina with Altavista and Achaval-Ferrer. In 1990, Pepe returned to Spain to manage Bodegas Enrique Mendoza with the help of his brother, Julián. Now a part of a new generation of winegrowers, Pepe’s fundamental objective at Enrique Mendoza is to attain grapes of the highest quality. All of the plants are nurtured using compost fertilizer and environmentally friendly practices, without insecticides or herbicides. Pepe’s belief is that great wine comes from a great vineyard.</p>",

Both men fell in love with the dry rugged landscape and the calcareous cliffs at the seashore village of Garraf just south of Barcelona. In 2008 after finding a location for the winery in an older building dating back to 1936, the project began in earnest. The winery focuses on local varieties of Xarello and Garnacha Blanca sourced from single-estate plots influenced by their individual soil types and the Catalan coastal mountain range, which rises to 2,156 feet at its highest point inland. The grapes are hand-harvested from head-trained 80-year-old vines and reach the winery within two hours of picking without the use of herbicides. It’s exciting to see how Vins del Massis combines the voluminous body and aging potential of Garnacha Blanca with the taught linear qualities of Xarello and aromatics influenced by a pre-fermentation cold soak, lees aging, and the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>",

Founded in 1921 by Joan Juvé Baqués and his wife Teresa Camps Farré, the winery’s three-generation history has resulted in an international reputation for producing top-quality Cava.</p><p>The story of Juvé &amp; Camps actually began over 200 years ago when Joan Juvé Mir, a bold and enterprising vine grower with ideas ahead of his time, laid the foundation for what would become the family firm. His son, Antoni Juvé Escaiola, carried on the legacy. There were many challenges, including the terrible phylloxera plague. Advocating replanting (as did other leading figures of the Penedès), he led a drive to restore the vineyards and to rebuild the region’s wine production. Respected and loved by his contemporaries, his example encouraged his son, Joan Juvé Baqués, to build the family’s first winery. Joan Juvé Baqués married Teresa Camps Farré, an exceptional woman and an enthusiastic supporter who, in 1921, inspired her husband to launch the first sparkling wine under the Juvé brand. It was made in the underground cellars beneath the family home in San Sadurní d’Anoia.</p><p>Today, Juvé &amp; Camps has established itself as the most highly regarded Cava producer in Spain. Juvé &amp; Camps wines are regularly served at state banquets given by Spain’s Royal Family and are offered to visitors and guests by the National Government, the Senate and Congress.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Juvé &amp; Camps comprises 2700 acres of vineyards. Those acres are divided into three properties where native varieties Parellada, Macabeo and Xarel-lo are grown.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>From the beginning, the winery’s philosophy has been to use only traditional, high-quality winemaking practices. Its Cava is made in the método tradicional, as is Champagne, meaning it undergoes a secondary, in-bottle fermentation prompted by the addition of yeast and sugar. The wines are often aged in bottle for 18 months or more.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Ànima Negra was founded in 1994 when two self-taught friends — Pere Ignasi Obrador and Miquelàngel Cerdà — decided that the wines of their native Mallorca weren’t reaching full potential. Taking advantage of some unused milk tanks at the dairy farm owned by Pere’s family, they made two barriques of wine from Callet grapes (a native Mallorcan varietal) they’d purchased from local farmers. The initial results were so encouraging that the friends decided to form a partnership and continue pursuing their newly found passion for wine.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Situated in the southeast of Mallorca, Ànima Negra winery produces its wines on the old country estate of Son Burguera, close to the town of Felanitx. The buildings date back to the 13th century, and contain a traditional winemaking area, which historically was used to supply wine for locals living on and near the estate.</p><p>Ànima Negra sources its grapes from more than 135 carefully selected parcels of land that the partners either own or control. Virtually all of these parcels are within a six-mile radius of the winery, and most of the vines are 50 to 85 years old.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Natural farming is prioritized at Ànima&nbsp;Negra. The vines are dry-farmed and are not fertilized, helping to ensure they produce small, concentrated fruit. Chemical insecticides and herbicides are avoided in favor of biodynamic practices, and indigenous yeasts are used for almost all fermentation.The resulting unique, elegant wines have garnered worldwide praise, and earned a loyal following among fine wine enthusiasts throughout the world. In 2010, the Slow Food Movement honored Ànima Negra with induction into the Ark of Taste.</p><p>Pere Ignasi Obrador was born in Felanitx on the island of Mallorca. After completing high school, he began studying to be an optician. His studies were interrupted when he was called upon to manage his family’s dairy farm, overseeing production from more than 400 dairy cows. While running the dairy, he avidly pursued independent study, focusing on genetics and biology. In 1994, he decided to convert a large portion of the family farm to pursue a new project: the production of wine made from indigenous grapes, particularly Callet. He gained his oenology knowledge through personal experience and periodic consultation with universities and prestigious oenologists, including Joan Milà. Over the years, he has established friendships with different Spanish and French oenologists who have generously shared their advice.</p><p>Miguelàngel Cerdà was born and grew up in Mallorca in the town of Felanitx, where his interests included sailing and astronomy. At 18, he moved to Madrid (a period he refers to as his “exile”) to study aeronautical engineering, a pursuit he continued for five years. But missing the sea terribly, Miguel decided to return to Mallorca. For the next decade he sailed the Mediterranean (which he affectionately refers to as Quíbia Gran) as one of the crew on the ship Margaret Alison, meeting diverse peoples in his travels. In 1994, he joined with Pere Obrador to create Ànima Negra. Putting his knowledge of chemistry (gained from his engineering studies) to good use, he assists Pere Ignasi Obrador with winemaking. He credits his friends — winemakers Ana Martín, Pepe Hidalgo and Joan Milà — with vastly improving his wine knowledge and providing invaluable advice in crafting Ànima Negra’s wines.</p>",

The vision of Finca Antigua is to create a facility that balances wine styles with the latest technologies, while always respecting the family’s enduring, time-honored winemaking traditions. At sharp contrast with the fresh, bucolic landscape, stands a structure of steel, stone and cement housing the equipment used to transform Finca Antigua harvests into spectacular wines.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>The estate is located on a prime parcel of land between the provinces of Cuenca and Toledo in DO La Mancha. The high altitude, soil of loam and limestone, and climate fluctuations from hot days to cool nights endow the vineyard with optimal growing conditions. A number of indigenous and international varieties thrive in the soil, the majority being Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo; but Syrah, Petit Verdot, Chardonnay, Graciano, Viura, Gewurztraminer, and Moscatel are also grown. The vineyards are marked by a multitude of old vines for which the property is named. All Finca Antigua wines are estate-grown and bottled.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Although the 21st century has brought modernization and automation to the winemaking process, the mission of the Familia Martínez-Bujanda has always remained true to the original intent of Joaquín Martínez-Bujanda from over a century ago: Control of the vineyards is essential to making complex wines. Each generation has sought to best utilize each location, taking into account the altitude, microclimate, soil and characteristics unique to each terroir, to create wines that capture its essence. They continue to nourish the vineyards with organic matter and employ modern and traditional winemaking techniques to produce the best-quality wine possible from each parcel.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Marqués de Griñón wines are sourced from the prized Dominio de Valdepusa vineyard in Castilla-La Mancha. Valdepusa stands apart from the rest of the region, as its 1068-foot elevation is one of the highest in Spain, and its top layer of soil is similar to Burgundy’s — it is almost pure limestone.</p><p>Dominio de Valdepusa has been in the noble family of Carlos Falcó Fernandez de Córdova, the Marquis of Griñon, since 1292. Referred to as the father of Spanish wine, Falcó pioneered the modernization of vine growing and winemaking in Spain. Falcó graduated from the University of California Davis with a degree in viticulture and oenology in 1964. He returned home and began making wine, all the while pushing the boundaries of winemaking as set by Francoist Spain. In 1974, he introduced the Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grape varieties as well as drip irrigation and night harvesting.</p><p>His experimentation with international varieties and modern technologies made him the internationally renowned expert on Spanish wine. In 1999 he published the 18-volume Entender de Vino, the quintessential guide to Spanish winemaking, now in its 13th edition. He also founded the esteemed Grandes Pagos de España association, with members including 27 of the most prestigious estates in Spain. The group’s mission is to defend and propagate the culture of pago wine, meaning wine produced in a specific terroir that reflects the distinct personality of the soil and climate.</p><p>In 2003, Dominio de Valdepusa became the first estate to receive DO de Pago, the highest level in the Spanish classification system. This level was introduced that same year and designates single estates of exceptional quality that exhibit the special characteristics of a pago. A pago is a landmass with indigenous vegetation that differentiates itself from the surrounding environment by soil type or microclimate. The site must have historically produced wines of exceptional quality and the single vineyard name must have been in use for at least five years. The vineyard site must be smaller than the communal or municipal boundary where it is located and there must be a quality-control system in place that complies at minimum with the regulations for a DOCa.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Dominio de Valdepusa is located in Castilla-La Mancha, some 31 miles from Toledo, near the Pusa River. It covers 50 hectares, 20 of which are planted primarily with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah. The balance is pristine land populated by local varieties of oak, wild olive trees, brush, thyme and rosemary, which contribute to the overall complexity and personality of the single estate. The family believes in the importance of the terroir and does its utmost to transmit the land’s characteristics to their grapes, including the soil’s physical, mineral and biological characteristics.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>A reputable winemaker in his own right, Falcó has invited top experts from around the world to help continually improve Marqués de Griñón's processes. Legendary Bordeaux oenologists Michel Rolland and Émile Peynaud; soil expert Claude Bourguignon; and Australian viticulturalist Dr. Richard Smart have consulted at Marques de Griñon since 1990, helping to implement the technologies and methods that make the winery one of the most advanced in the world. These include a partial root-drying system, sub-surface drip irrigation, high-canopy trellising, gravity-fed tanks, hand de-stemming and an abandonment of fining and filtration, all of which give the wines their famously powerful and concentrated style.</p><p>Julio Mourelle has been the winemaker at Marqués de Griñón since 1995. Raised in La Coruña in Galicia, Mourelle holds a B.S. in pharmacology from the University of Santiago in Spain, where he majored in plant physiology. Mourelle also was awarded a master’s degree in viticulture and oenology from the University of California Davis, where he studied under leading oenology researcher, Roger Boulton.</p><p>While at Davis, Mourelle interned at Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars and later became assistant winemaker in charge of experimental wines at Sterling Vineyards in Napa Valley. Working with California wineries and their cutting-edge viticultural and oenological techniques deeply influenced Mourelle’s views on winemaking.</p><p>Returning to his homeland at just 29 years of age, Julio Mourelle found a Spain that remained largely traditional in its winemaking views and methods. He knew it would be difficult to find a winery where he could put his New World knowledge into practice. Dominio de Valdepusa, which was already pioneering various New World techniques in Europe, was a perfect match. Mourelle became the estate’s winemaker in 1995, and has been owner Carlos Falcó’s right-hand man from the start. His excellent work has helped establish Marqués de Griñón as a leader in Spanish winemaking.</p>",

          "description": "<p>This designation is located in the southern tip of Spain and was established in 1933, although its history dates back to 1587. The area’s light, reflective Albariza soils are rich in chalk, limestone, clay and sand. Ideal for the growth of the Palomino grape, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the grapes grown in this area. Wine here is based on the solera system, a method of aging and fractional blending using a series of oak barrels. Jerez ranges in style from dry (e.g., Fino, Amontillado, Palo Cortado, and Oloroso) to sweet (e.g., Cream Sherry and Pedro Ximénez). Manzanilla¸ exclusive to Sanlucar de Barrameda, develops under a thicker layer of flor protecting the wine even more from air contact resulting in a slightly lighter variety of Fino, containing virtually no glycerol and combining dry, saline notes with a fresh, zesty liveliness—displaying coastal aromas like sea spray, salt or even iodine.</p>",

              "slug": "la-guita",
              "description": "<p>The La Guita winery, nestled in the small town of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, was first established under Bodegas Hijos de Rainera Pérez Marín by founder Domingo Pérez Marín, in 1852. When curious patrons inquired about his top-of-the-line Manzanilla, he would simply reply, “Do you have the guita?” This term is derived from old Andalusian slang, meaning “cash,” though its more familiar definition translates to “string.” Today, a small piece of string adorns every bottle of this alluring Manzanilla as an homage to its humble beginnings.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Sanlucar de Barrameda dates back to Roman times. After the Romans invaded and built a defensive fort here, it evolved into a major port under the Catholics. Columbus set sail from Sanlúcar in 1498 and, a few decades later, the Portuguese Ferdinand Magellan set off to circumnavigate the globe from here in search of a westerly route to the spice islands of Indonesia. The town is situated at the northern tip of the sherry triangle (the other two points being Jerez and El Puerto de Santa Maria) and is located on the Guadalquivir river estuary which empties into Atlantic Ocean in the Cadiz Province of Andalucía (Southwest Spain). The bodega is situated inside the very same walls of what was once Sanlúcar de Barrameda’ s main hospital in 1589 inside of the city’s striking historic center.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>La Guita is the only Manzanilla produced exclusively from the Pago Miraflores vineyards around Sanlúcar; an area known for its famed Albariza Superior soils (the highest soil-quality standard, according to the DO Sherry Regulatory Board) that lend the characteristic mineral quality that makes this Manzanilla so memorable. La Guita sees tremendous success in its domestic market as the leading Sherry/Manzanilla brand in Spain. A defining principle of the winery is that each bottle is prepared upon demand. La Guita was the first bodega to print the bottling date on its bottles, guaranteeing proper rotation and perpetuating its trademark reputation of being the freshest Manzanilla in the market.</p><h4>Manzanilla</h4><p>Manzanilla is a form of fine, dry Sherry which is produced around the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Manzanilla Sherry is made in the same way as Fino Sherry however; the cooling Atlantic Ocean winds coming off the Gulf of Cadiz creates an environment where the yeast often grows better. The resulting thicker layer of yeast protects the wine from the air even further; giving the Sherry an even finer and more delicate flavor than other Fino Sherries.</p><p>There is an ongoing dispute surrounding the name of this variety of Spanish Sherry. Manzanilla translates to chamomile in Spanish (in Latin chamomile means “earth apple”) so some people believe this style of sherry is named after apples as it tastes a little bit like the fruit. Some people believe that it tastes like chamomile tea. Other theories claim that the grape vine used at the beginning of the existence of this drink was called manzanilla and that the wines resemble those that came from the town of Manzanilla during the 15th century.</p>",

              "description": "<p>Bodegas Emilio Hidalgo was founded in 1874 and has developed an international reputation for producing elegant, refined Sherries. Located in the historical heart of Jerez de la Frontera, the winery is housed in a late-19th century building of classic construction — thick walls, large windows, high ceilings and tiled roof — ideal for the fermentation and aging of Sherry.</p><p>By the beginning of the 20th century the winery was already well established, with a devoted following in Spain and the U.K. By the 1970s, Bodegas Emilio Hidalgo had expanded exportation to discerning Sherry drinkers in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Denmark, the U.S. and Japan.</p><p>Today, the fifth generation of Hidalgos runs the winery, carrying on the family’s rich Sherry-making heritage. This new generation maintains the traditions that have been carefully preserved and enriched for more than 130 years. Through their efforts, Bodegas Emilio Hidalgo continues to be recognized worldwide for its high quality and distinct style. The winery has received countless accolades from Sherry connoisseurs and top critics.</p><h4>Location of Vineyard</h4><p>Emilio Hidalgo is located in the heart of Jerez de la Frontera, in DO Jerez-Xérès-Sherry. Palomino, Moscatel and Pedro Ximenez grapes are grown in three types of soil: limestone-rich albariza, clay-dominant barros and sandy arenas. This varied yield of grapes gives Hidalgo’s skilled cellar master a wide range of options in the crafting of their Sherry.</p><h4>Winemaking Philosophy</h4><p>Hidalgo has had the same cellar master, or capataz, for the past five decades, continuing the artisanal ways of the winery. An expert at managing the house’s various soleras, he employs a system of fractional blending, using smell and taste to monitor development and to create Hidalgo’s famously complex Sherries.</p><p>In the great tradition of Jerez, Hidalgo’s winemaker is the capataz of the winery. Yet, he is more of a caretaker of the wine. Hidalgo wine develops in-barrel, while he oversees and guides this development. Historically, a capataz hones his skill rising through the ranks, learning what different types of wines “should” smell and taste like, according to house style.</p><p>Hidalgo’s current capataz is Manuel Nieves. Raised in Jerez, he learned much from his father, who also was a capataz. Manuel came to Hidalgo in 1959, and, as is the tradition, he learned the trade from his predecessor. He became Hidalgo’s capataz in 1972 and has continued to produce the same level of high-quality wine for which Hidalgo has been known. Upon his retirement, his son, Manuel Jesus Nieves, is slated to replace him.</p><p>Since taking his licentiature in Chemistry in 2004 from the University of Cadiz, Manuel Jesus has worked full time as Hidalgo’s oenologist and apprentice winemaker. Prior to that he spent many summers working in the winery and picking grapes during harvest. New times require new methods, and Manuel Jesus brings a modern scientific touch to Hidalgo’s traditional method of wine production.</p>",
